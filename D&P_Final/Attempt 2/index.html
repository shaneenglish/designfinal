            <h2>A Lack of Foresight</h2>
            <p id="intro">In March 2001, defense contractor EOTech signed a $7.35 million
            agreement with the Department of Defense to provide sights for
            automatic rifles. The sights proved to be defective and EOTech
            settled with the US Government for $25 million in November 2015.
            When EOTech became aware of the flaw, they were not only slow to
            take action, they attempted, unsuccessfully to sell the sights to
            other countries. It was not until the FBI conducted an independent
            investigation that EOTech's sights were found to be faulty by the
            United States. After the FBI discovered the flaws, the US Attorney
            Preet Bharara's office filed a civil suit. EOTech settled within 24
            hours. Instead of being disallowed to bid for contracts, EOTech
            continued to bid and receive contracts with the United States
            government, highlighting a disturbing trend in the United States'
            military spending.</p>

                <h2>A Decade of Fraud</h2>
                <p>Debarment is the process by which the government prevents
                contractors, whether individuals or companies, from bidding on
                or accepting government contracts. A contractor can be debarred
                for fraud, back taxes, or failing to adhere to drug-free
                workplace guidelines. However, debarment or suspension is
                completely separate from the legal process. A contractor can
                only be debarred by a head of a government agency, like the
                General Services Administration or Department of Defense, or an
                agent acting on a head's behalf.</p>
                <p>This means that a civil settlement with an admission of
                misconduct or fraud does not always result in the suspension or
                debarment of a contractor. The data gathered shows that
                numerous government contractors committed fraud and were found
                criminally or civilly liable but only paid fines. Granted,
                these fines were often in excess of $1 million but many of
                these companies received billions of dollars in government
                contracts each year.</p>
                <p>Despite allegations of fraud substantiated by an FBI
                investigation and US Attorney's office that span over 10 years,
                defense contractor EOTech remains eligible to do business with
                the US. EOTech agreed to pay $25.6 million to the US Government
                in November 2015 to settle allegations that the company
                violated the False Claims Act and defrauded the Department of
                Defense, the Army and the Navy over a 10-year period.</p>
                <p>Beginning in 2001, EOTech contracted with the Department of
                Defense, the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI to
                provide weapons sights capable of withstanding extreme
                temperatures and combat conditions. By 2006, EOTech learned
                that its sights would fail in cold or humid conditions and
                failed to disclose this information to the government according
                to the complaint filed by the US Attorneys Office for Southern
                New York.</p>
                <p>EOTech is an optics company that provides weapons sights and
                surveillance equipment to the US government as well as to
                retail clients. EOTech invented and designed the first
                holographic weapon sight at the turn of the 21st
                century.EOTech's holographic sights were commonly used by US
                Special Forces because their design allowed soldiers to keep
                both eyes open while aiming, reducing the loss of peripheral
                vision. The company marketed its holographic weapon sights as
                capable of functioning between -40 degrees to 140 degrees
                Fahrenheit. EOTech also claimed that the sights could withstand
                extremely humid conditions.</p>
                <p>According to the complaint by the US Attorney's office, the
                performance standards were crucial because "US troops used
                EOTech's combat optical sights in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well
                as in the jungle, mountains, desert, and other extreme
                environmental conditions around the world." EOTech's 2004 and
                2010 contracts, worth a total of $20.4 million, explicitly
                stated that EOTech must "notify the Government of any and all
                performance related data" affecting the sights.</p>

            <p>Internal EOTech documents reveal that in August of 2006, an army
            infantry unit complained that the target reticle drifted off-center
            in extreme temperatures. Anthony Tai, EOTech's Chief Technology
            Officer at the time, ordered immediate testing. In an email to
            company higher-ups, Tai wrote, "We cannot have soldiers test our
            sights for drift in the battlefield." During a deposition, the test
            engineer responsible for evaluating the sights said that he didn't
            remember anyone attempting to fix the flaws.</p>
                <p>Despite the attention of the CTO, the problem was neither
                fixed nor acknowledged until the FBI independently uncovered
                the flaw in 2015. The FBI exposed the sights to weather in
                Virginia and noticed that the targeting reticle drifted away
                from the center. Notably, Virginia rarely reaches the highs of
                140 degrees Fahrenheit or lows of -40 degrees Fahrenheit that
                EOTech claimed its sights could withstand.</p>
                <p>When confronted by the FBI in 2015, EOTech claimed that the
                flaw was newly discovered. EOTech learned of a second flaw in
                its holographic sights when it attempted to sell its optics to
                the Norwegian Army in January 2007. During field-testing in
                Norway, however, the aiming dot distorted, making proper aiming
                very difficult. Norway passed on EOTech's sights yet the
                company continued to provide these same optics to the US
                Military.</p>

                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>EOTech's CTO issued an internal memo admitting that the
                company "had never looked at the sight performance at very low
                temperatures" and that EOTech "assumed the sight performed
                about the same at" 68 degrees Fahrenheit as it did between -40
                degrees and 104 degrees Fahrenheit. [Note: To maintain
                consistency, temperatures were converted to Fahrenheit from
                Celsius]</p>
                <p>EOTech did not disclose this flaw to the military until
                2008, when, instead of acknowledging the distortion effect, the
                company informed the US government that they were upgrading the
                sights' performance as opposed to correcting a flaw. Despite
                fraudulently representing its sights and withholding
                information about failure from the US government, EOTech was
                slapped with a fine that barely exceeded the total of its
                contracts. According to the publicly available data, the US
                purchased at least $24 million worth of EOTech's sights.</p>
                <p>Within 24 hours of the US Attorney's office filing a
                complaint to recover triple the damages, as allowed by the
                False Claims Act, as well as civil penalties, EOTech settled.
                The terms of the settlement required that the company, its
                parent company L-3 and EOTech's former president Paul Mangano
                admit responsibility for the company's fraudulent actions and
                pay $25.6 million.</p>
                <p>Although EOTech and L-3 Communications admitted and
                acknowledged fraudulent activity, the GSA and EOTech's
                government contracting official declined to suspend or debar
                either subsidiary or parent company. Instead of preventing
                EOTech or L-3 Communications from continuing to bid on, the
                contracting official used his or her discretion to do
                nothing.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>A representative for EOTech and its parent company L-3
        Communications said to the reporters that the company had no comment
        about the settlement. The General Services Administration's Suspension
        and Debarment Division would not comment on specific cases other than
        to refer to EOTech and L-3's System for Award Management records, which
        do not show any suspensions or debarments.</p><a href="index.html">Back

                <h2>A Pattern of Inaction</h2>
                <p>The perpetuated fraud on EOTech's part and lack of
                substantial punishment or disbarment from the Department of
                Defense and United States government are indicative of a larger
                issue among defense contractors. EOTech is hardly the only
                defense contractor to engage in fraudulent activities, continue
                to bid and receive contracts, and then either pay minute or no
                fines at all. To that end we've researched the depth of defense
                contractors engaged in this cycle.</p>

                            it is to hire and fire fulltime government
                            employees." <cite>Benjamin Friedman, Cato

                        <p>In fiscal year 2014, the top ten contractors alone
                        were awarded $117.7 billion in government contracts.
                        "There's a history of a private arsenals as opposed to
                        public arsenals in the wake of WWII," said Benjamin
                        Friedman of the Cato Institute. Defense contracting
                        grew out of a need for the government to be able to
                        quickly mobilize businesses and ramp up production in
                        response to varying global events. “It's easier to
                        temporarily hire a contractor than it is to hire and
                        fire full-time government employees,” said
                        Friedman.</p>
                        <p>Essentially, Friedman explained, the contracting
                        system allows an agency of the US government to procure
                        specific items or to research new technology without
                        creating an entire department within the agency. For
                        instance: instead of purchasing and manufacturing small
                        arms in government owned and operated plants, the
                        Department of Defense can use existing private arms
                        companies to quickly furnish the needed supplies.</p>
                        <p>"Though it can be bogged down by politics and the
                        costs of doing business in Washington, ideally,
                        allowing the government to employ private businesses
                        will increase efficiency," said Friedman. Friedman adds
                        that the system looks much more chaotic and clumsy from
                        the outside. "For contracting officers, this is just
                        the nature of the system," he said.</p>

                            system means that contractors are often left to
                            police themselves by internal audit (for financial
                            fraud like overcharging/mischarging for labor) or
                            by contractual obligation (if providing materials
                            or products) said Neil Gordon from the Project on

                        lot of discrepancies between contractors and the
                        government come down to human error, not malice," said
                        Gordon. Gordon concurred with Friedman's assessment,
                        adding that contractors that adopt a policy of
                        transparency after a mistake typically continue to do
                        business with the US.</p>
                        <p>William Schmidt, of the GSA's Suspension and
                        Debarment Division declined to say how often
                        investigators recommend suspension or debarment when
                        misconduct is discovered. He also declined to say often
                        contracting officials actually use their ability to
                        suspend or debar offending contractors.</p>

                            <p>EOTech's pattern of fraud is notable for its
                            duration and the rigorous internal documentation
                            that ultimately implicated the company. Yet EOTech
                            is just one company competing for billions of
                            dollars in defense contracts. It's one company
                            among many that have settled allegations of fraud
                            without debarment or suspension as shown by the
                            data available from POGO and information confirmed
                            by the General Service Administration's Suspension
                            and Debarment online database.</p>
                            <p>The General Services Administration's (GSA)
                            Suspension and Disbarment Division keeps track of
                            contractors that are under investigation or have
                            been debarred but does not investigate fraud or
                            misconduct on their own, said William Schmidt.
                            However, under the Federal Acquisition Regulations,
                            debarment and suspension are considered separate
                            from criminal or civil charges and are not decided
                            by attorneys, said Schmidt.</p>
                            <p>Schmidt explained that there are often
                            extenuating circumstances that prevent contracting
                            officials from suspending companies. Oftentimes,
                            companies are providing invaluable service to the
                            government, said Schmidt. "Debarment is entirely at
                            the discretion of the contracting official," said
                            Gordon, of POGO. "It's subjective. Even when a
                            company acknowledges wrongdoing, it's perfectly
                            legal for them to continue bidding on
                            contracts."</p><a href="index.html">Back to top</a>
